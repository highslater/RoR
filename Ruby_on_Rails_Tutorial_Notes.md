Chapter 1  
From zero to deploy  
  
In this first chapter, we’ll get started with Ruby on Rails by installing all  
the necessary software and by setting up our development environment.  

We’ll then create our first Rails application, called hello_app. Immediately  
after we’ll put it under version control with Git. And, put our first app on  
the wider web by deploying it to production.
